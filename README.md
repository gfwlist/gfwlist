# gfwlist
## The OFFICIAL gfwlist here!

Everyone knows that netizens in Mainland China are under oppression. There is a government-run firewall that blocks and interferes with websites containing sensitive or unwanted information. Meanwhile there’s an extensive network of self-censors in all domestic Internet companies who delete contents which might incur the wrath of the people behind the rigorous censorship regime, while there are also lots of websites refuse to crouch. Hence they are often blocked.

There are other cases for example many streaming services or restricted content providers have blocked IPs from China. What a pity!

We don't dismantle the wall, we just find a hole to bypass then instead. Don't ask us how to bypass, we don't know. And don't ask us what a wall is, it's not a continuous vertical brick or stone structure that encloses or divides an area of land.

TL;DR: This list embraces websites which Chinese authorities and some service providers don't want Chinese to view on the Internet.

WARNING:

* Due to the peculiar network control, it is **impractical** to deal with reports from users of provinces below:

  - Tibet (Tibet Autonomous Region)
  - Shinjang (XinJiang Uyghur Autonomous Region)
  - Qinghai (Qinghai Province)
  
  Example: Baidu Wangpan is not allowed to use in XinJiang, but adding it into the list will cause trouble to the people living in the rest of the country.
  
  Therefore, any user within these areas is encouraged to either maintain custom rules, or use proxy all the time.

* GFWList doesn't provide prompt update for URLs submitted, normally they will be fully tested before adding into the list.

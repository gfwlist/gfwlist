## The OFFICIAL gfwlist here!

Everyone knows that Chinese people are living in a special environment. There is a government-run firewall that blocks and interferes with websites containing sensitive or unwanted information. Meanwhile thereâ€™s an extensive network of self-censors in all domestic Internet companies who delete contents they fear which might incur the wrath of the regime, but there are also lots of websites refuse to do that. Hence they are often blocked.

There are other cases for example many streaming services or restricted contents provider have blocked IPs from China. What a pity!

We don't dismantle the wall, we just find a hole to bypass then instead. Don't ask us how to bypass, we don't know.

TL;DR: This list embraces websites which Chinese authorities and some service providers don't want Chinese to view on the Internet.
